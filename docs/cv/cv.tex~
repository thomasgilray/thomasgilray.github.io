    \end{tabbing}\vspace{-0.5cm}
    Developed a unified methodology for polyvariant (\textit{e.g.}, call sensitive, object sensitive, etc) static analysis and applied the approach to produce a 
    specific adaptive style of polyvariance, obtaining a form of perfect precision at no asymptotic cost to analysis complexity. 
    
    The technique avoids all return-flow conflation of values (a long-standing problem for control-flow analyses), guaranteeing perfect stack precision
    and at no cost in terms of human labor to implement, and both average and worst-case model complexity.
    %
    Proved that the precision is equal to an incomputable analysis with an unbounded stack and mechanically verified the proof using the Coq system.
    %
    My dissertation is titled \textit{``Introspective Polyvariance for Control-Flow Analyses''}.

   Joined UMD's PLUM lab with Michael W. Hicks, Jeffery Foster, and David Van Horn; worked on various collaborative projects including: soft contract verification, approximating permission-use provenance in Android, accelerating flow analyses in Datalog, and verification of faceted programs, among others. My departmental fellowship granted me enormous freedom to pursue my research goals in an ideal supportive context.

   \end{tabbing}\vspace{-0.5cm}      % suppress blank line after tabbing
   Developed a new undergraduate Compilers course, with input from others in PLUM lab,
   and taught it to 40 students. In the class, we studied a variety of interpreters
   for different language features and their respective compiler translations. Each student built a substantial
   Scheme compiler in a series of small passes that compiles most of R\textsuperscript{7}RS (with some Racket
   extensions such as pattern matching) down to LLVM IR that uses the Boehm conservative garbage collector. Taught the core undergrad Programming Languages course.

   Started as a graduate intern in Summer 2013 and was hired to work another year, concurrent with my work in the U-combinator lab.
   Implemented an inter-procedural must-alias analysis based on the theory of \emph{abstract counting} to supplement existing analyses in the Fortify source-code analyzer (SCA).
   Successfully addressed various bug reports and performed an architectural review of SCA's ``phase 0'' preprocessing code which performs initial analyses such as SSA conversion.

    Studied static analysis (particularly for functional languages) using abstract interpretation.
    %
    Conducted research, with a variety of collaborators, studying polyvariant program analysis, implementing analyses as
    operational semantics (interpreters) and as linear algebra, and designing a new dynamic sparse-matrix format for SIMD hardware (such as GPUs).
    %
    Participated in a lab-wide effort on the timed challenge events for DARPA's APAC program. 
    %
    Each of these involved using our lab's static analysis tools to assist a collaborative effort identifing
    hidden malware deliberately planted in a series of android applications.

    Also assisted teaching for undergraduate \textit{``Compilers''} and graduate \textit{``Advanced Compilers''}, helping to design assignments
    (including open and closed test suites), grading, and

   Raised \$3,000 in start-up funds to build an art-sharing platform with two friends. Built out a high-performance backend and AJAST-style
   load-balancing to handle requests from a web-gallery front-end in Javascript. The site was home to more than $14,000$ works of art contributed
   by roughly $800$ active users. Wrote a message-board engine with social-media features. Wrote a secure CAPTCHA and various image processing
