\begin{resume}        

\vspace{-0.1in}  
I am currently an Associate Professor in Computer Science at Washington State University, and was previously Assistant Professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and a Victor Basili Fellow at the University of Maryland, at College Park.

%My research interests center around the design and (scalable) implementation of high-level programming languages and systems for reasoning automatically about programs. I have contributed to the design of tunable whole-program control-flow analyses, information-flow analyses, contract verification systems, and have invented novel Datalog-based languages for implementing these analyses efficiently---and declaratively. I have also contributed to high-performance-computing techniques for accelerating data-parallel relational algebra and sparse linear algebra on supercomputers.

    Developed a unified methodology for polyvariant (\textit{e.g.}, flow/call/arg/obj sensitive) program analysis.% and applied the approach to produce a 
    %specific adaptive style of polyvariance, obtaining a form of perfect precision at no asymptotic cost to analysis complexity. 
    
    I applied this framework to produce a self-reflective form of polyvariance for continuations that avoids all return-flow conflation of values (a long-standing problem for control-flow analyses), guaranteeing ideal stack precision at no cost to average or worst-case model complexity, and at in terms of human labor to implement ($\sim{}\!\!1$LOC in proposed framework).
    %
    Proved that the precision is equal to an incomputable analysis with an unbounded stack and mechanically verified the proof using the Coq proof assistant.
    %
    My dissertation is titled \textit{``Introspective Polyvariance for Control-Flow Analyses''}.

   Joined UMD's PLUM lab with Michael W. Hicks, Jeffery Foster, and David Van Horn; worked on various collaborative projects including: soft contract verification, approximating permission-use provenance in Android, accelerating flow analyses in Datalog, and verification of faceted programs, among others. A departmental fellowship granted me great freedom to pursue long-term research.
