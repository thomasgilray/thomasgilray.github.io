\begin{resume}        

\vspace{-0.1in}  
I am currently an Assistant Professor in Computer Science at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, and was previously a Victor Basili Fellow at the University of Maryland, at College Park.

My research interests center around the design and (scalable) implementation of high-level programming languages and systems for reasoning automatically about programs. I have contributed to the design of tunable whole-program control-flow analyses, information-flow analyses, contract verification systems, and have invented novel Datalog-based languages for implementing these analyses efficiently---and declaratively. I have also contributed to high-performance-computing techniques for accelerating data-parallel relational algebra and sparse linear algebra on supercomputers.

    Developed a unified methodology for polyvariant (\textit{e.g.}, flow/call/arg/obj sensitive) program analysis.% and applied the approach to produce a 
    %specific adaptive style of polyvariance, obtaining a form of perfect precision at no asymptotic cost to analysis complexity. 
    
    I applied this framework to produce a self-reflective form of polyvariance for continuations that avoids all return-flow conflation of values (a long-standing problem for control-flow analyses), guaranteeing ideal stack precision at no cost to average or worst-case model complexity, and at in terms of human labor to implement ($\sim{}\!\!1$LOC in proposed framework).
    %
    Proved that the precision is equal to an incomputable analysis with an unbounded stack and mechanically verified the proof using the Coq proof assistant.
    %
    My dissertation is titled \textit{``Introspective Polyvariance for Control-Flow Analyses''}.

   Following a graduate internship in Summer 2013, I was hired to work remotely, concurrent with my work in the U-combinator lab.
   I implemented a new inter-procedural must-alias analysis based on the theory of \emph{abstract counting} to supplement existing analyses in the Fortify source-code analyzer (SCA).
   I successfully addressed various bug reports and lead an architectural review of SCA's ``phase 0'' preprocessing code which performs SSA conversion and intra-procedural analysis.

    I studied polyvariant program analysis in Matt Might's U-combinator lab, implementing analyses as
    traditional operational semantics (abstract interpreters) and as linear algebra, to exploit inherent parallelism, and designing a new dynamic sparse-matrix format for SIMD hardware (such as GPUs).

\section{\large Teaching} \vspace{0.2in}
    
\textbf{(UAB) CS 401/501: Programming Languages} (Spring 2019--2024)

I designed and taught a Programming Languages course for undergraduates at UAB. The course surveys a variety of languages features and paradigms, focusing especially on introducing functional and declarative programming, language design, semantics, and interpreters. The class is programming intensive, with a series of six projects and biweekly exercises, and includes a modest focus on implementation strategies. Students build a church compiler, both small-step and big-step interpreters, and a purely functional implementation of PageRank, among other unique projects.

\textbf{(UAB) CS 660/760: Artificial Intelligence} (Fall 2019--2021, 2023)

I designed and taught an AI course that focuses on symbolic AI, logic, and automated reasoning (UAB has six other courses focusing on Machine Learning, which is outside my primary areas of expertise). We focus on problem solving by search, adversarial search and games, automated constraint solving, SAT solving, and logic. Students complete group projects focusing on A*, two-player Reversi, and Sudoku solving and complete an individual term project. As my own research in Datalog falls within the scope of this course, I spend at least a week near the end of the term focusing on logic programming and HornSAT/Datalog after the students have implemented DPLL.

\textbf{(UAB) CS 350/550: Automata and Formal Languages} (Fall 2018--2023)

I improved UAB's existing course on automata, formal languages, and the theory of computation by adding two substantial coding projects to supplement the class' theoretical focus. For example, I added a project where students build an automata library to convert a given regular expression to an NFA, convert this to a DFA, and then minimize the DFA. This library can match strings using any intermediate model of regular languages and can visualize any NFA/DFA using Graphviz so students can visually inspect the NFAs and DFAs they are building. I have also increased the class' focus on parsing and added a project where students write their own recursive descent parser for a toy programming language.

\textbf{(UMD) CMSC 330: Intro to Programming Languages} (Spring 2018)

I taught a spring section of CMSC 330, UMD's core Programming Languages course which covers a series of languages and paradigms (using Ruby, OCaml, Rust, Prolog) and core PL theory on lambda calculus, semantics, and type systems. 

\textbf{(UMD) CMSC 430: Compilers} (Fall 2017)

I designed and taught an elective course on compiler implementation at UMD. The class was based around a central project, composed of bite-sized chunks, where students build their own Scheme-to-LLVM-IR compiler, from scratch. The course covered standard intermediate representations, implementation of effects, exception handling, garbage collection, and first-class control. Every student managed to complete a working Scheme compiler by the end of the term.
